# Cloneable Services Architecture

A modular, service-based architecture that enables rapid deployment of applications through reusable, cloneable services.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build all packages
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test
```

## Services

### Payment Service
The first cloneable service implementation, providing:
- Transaction processing
- Ledger system
- Payment processor integration
- Security layer
- Platform-agnostic UI components

See [services/payment/README.md](./services/payment/README.md) for details.

## Core Concepts

### Cloneable Services
Pre-built, self-contained service modules that can be cloned and integrated into any application.

### Service Assembly
Services can be included individually or as bundles, with configuration handling customization.

### Platform Support
- Progressive Web Apps (PWA) - Primary
- Native Mobile Applications - Planned
- Traditional Web Applications - Planned
